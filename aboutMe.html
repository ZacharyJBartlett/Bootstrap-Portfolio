    <div>I first believed that I would grow up and get a job in manufacturing, and I did. For the first part of my adult life, all I did was manual labor, whether it be welding, construction, quality control, or landscaping. My brother first introduced me
        to web development back in 2013, and I dabbled in it from time to time, never really commiting to it. Last year I got invited to take a coding bootcamp through UNC for full stack web development. Since that time I have poured countless hours into
        web development, from front end design to the meat of the backend, I have done more than I realized was possible. I am currently doing freelance work to get a better understanding of what the field is looking for right now, and always looking
        for ways to improve the skills I currently have.
